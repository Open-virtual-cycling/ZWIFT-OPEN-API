# ZWIFT-OPEN-API
An open API proposal from the developer community.

Currently, Zwift has limited developer API access and unofficial public API access. There is a large community of developers building unofficial virtual world gadgets, features, apps that enhance the Zwift experience. The goal of this proposal is to request a developer API setup under an open organization to manage access to the API and the privacy and compliance of the developers.

General implementation idea:

    Sever setup to proxy all requests. Possibly with secure key system
    Each developer would need to make their code open to the at least the origination.
    Setup system to limit or require the storing of private data within secure GDPR compliant system.
    A structure for providing monetary resource for the project
    A way for developers to charge for use of their apps?
